# Introduction to Programming With Python

*Introduction to Programming With Python* (from Launch School) covers the basics of Python such as variables, data types, functions, methods, inputs and outputs, and collections. This repository serves as a collection of my own work on the exercises provided assigned within the textbook.

## Exercises

The exercises are completed and recorded on markdown files in each folder corresponding to the name of the chapter accordingly. 

*There could be formatting inconsistencies especially in code fences, as the markdown files are edited in Typora.*
